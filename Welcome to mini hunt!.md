# Poetry 🌶️

THOU HE <u>BALK</u> "REMOVER"

2020 sucked I knew,  
Clubs and bars I saw no <input type="text" size='5' class="poetry">.  
Real life friends I hardly see,  
No more cafe catchup <input type="text" size='5' class="poetry">.  
Inside no masks was a sin,  
Takeout replaced dining <input type="text" size='5' class="poetry">.  
New year spring brings outdoor botany,  
Also hope and vaccines for m<input type="text" size='5' class="poetry">.
