# Poem  🌶️

2020, what a year to live through.  
At movies, bars, and clubs, there’s no longer a \_\_\_.  
I used to commute from Alewife to Braintree,  
But now I work from home. I don’t need the \_\_\_.   
Going inside without masks, now considered a sin,  
Forget going to restaurants, you should only stay \_\_\_.  
New year and vaccines, I’ll celebrate with Henny,  
I have hopes and dreams, do you have \_\_\_?  

THOU HE BALK "REMOVER"
